# Getting and Cleaning Data Tidy Data Set

# The data combines different files accross the UCI data set into one summarized data set.

# To get one variable and one observation, the data set uses the following activities in the "activity" column:
#1 WALKING
#2 WALKING_UPSTAIRS
#3 WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS
#4 SITTING
#5 STANDING
#6 LAYING

#To get the observations for 30 subjects by activity, the data set uses all columns that include variables with a mean or standard deviation measure (by grepping relevant column names on "std" or "mean"), totaling 86 variables. See the actual data for reference.
